0.2 Inlcudes
	in c++, many fundamentals facilities, such as input output, are part of the standard library,
rather than being part of the core language. so we have to ask for the parts that we need to use.
	Programs ask for standard-library facilities by using $include <directives>, includes normaly appear at the beginning
of a program.
	to use output input we requist them by writing
#include <iostrean> (standard header)

0.3 the main function

a function is a piece of code that has a name and do something, and that another program can call or cause to run.
every prograe must contain a function named main. wehn we ask the c++ to run a program , it does so bu calling this function.

the main funtion must returns an intger as it's result.

int main()

0.4 Curly braces

int main()
{
	// all parts between braces are part of the function
}

0.5 Using the standard library for output

////

0.6 return statement;

ends excution of the function in which it appears. and passes the value between (0) back to the program that called func.
