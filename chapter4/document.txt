Program structure:

#include <system-header>
Angle brackets, < > , enclose system headers. System headers may or may not b e
implemented as files

#include "user-defined-header-file-name"
User-defined header files are include d by enclosing the name in quotes. Typically ,
user-defined headers have a suffix of .h .

Header files should be guarded against multiple inclusion by wrapping the file in an  #ifndef
GUARD _ header_name directive. Headers should avoid declaring names that they do not use .
In particular, they should not include using -declarations, but instead should prefi x
standard-library names with std::  explicitly.
